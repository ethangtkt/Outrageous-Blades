## 🏆 Notable Acheviements
#### ROBLOX Admins
Roblox admins are employees at ROBLOX headquarters. They develop and work on the game engine, website, avatars, and events. Producing Outrageous Blades, I had many employees play and give constructive criticism. These people playing this game were a significant accomplishment since many of these people I looked up to as role models. Many of these people are still very notable people within the community.
<br>
#### ROBLOX's "Front Page"
Even six years later, getting to the front page is still an outstanding achievement. The "Front Page" is a term used in Roblox to represent the top games on the site at the time. The games with the most concurrent players will reach the top of the site. In 2014-2015, there was an area on the front page called the "Featured Section" where the only way to have your game come across that section was to have a ROBLOX Admin hand pick it and add it. On February 18th, 2016, a very generous ROBLOX admin decided to feature my game in the "Featured Section.” The front page featured Outrageous Blades for about two months before ROBLOX employees took it off to allow new talent to show off their games!

#### Game Visits
I had an overwhelming amount of people play the game, enough people for me to even understand as a young man in my computer science career. Total, we had 360,000 people play between 2014 and 2016. In addition, there was a total of 177,000 unique players joining the game.

## ℹ About The Game
In 2015, I made this game when I was 15 years old, and the total development time was around 5-6 months. It was an addition to my "Outrageous" game series that I had on Roblox at the time.  This game is a highly interactive and intense battle. The game features seven minigames and thirty-two maps involving hundreds of ways minigames can play out. Players will earn in-game currency to spend on different types of cosmetic items, like sword skins, player trails, pets, and gift boxes. The more a player will battle, the more in-game experience they will collect. Leveling up your character will give opportunities to upgrade how strong the player will be in battle. The cartoon-style adventure gives players a fun experience making it easy to play for hours!

## 🕹 Different Types Of Minigames
### 👑 Traditional Bracket
The traditional bracket was one of the first minigames. Think of this minigame as a march madness bracket. We take all the people in the game and face them up against each other in pairs.  The winner of that pair will move on to the next round. This process will continue until the final match up where a winner will be declared. This game mode had to have a lot of error handling. For example, if someone leaves the game, if there are an odd number of players, or if someone leaves the match. This game mode shaped the rest of the game modes below.

<br><br>
### 👫 2 vs. 2 .vs 2
This minigame was an exciting mode to implement. It creates three teams of two and puts them in a match together. The three teams will start on the left, middle, and right sides. The game will clearly label each pair in-game with green, blue, or red arrows above their heads. The last team standing wins 250 bells and some in-game experience.

<br><br>
### 💪 Juggernaut 
Juggernaut is one of the most remarkable game modes I came across when researching. One random player has to face every other player in the game; this player is called the Juggernaut. The Juggernaut’s sword will have the same power as every other player’s sword, but his health will equal the health of all the players he is facing. So, for example, if the juggernaut is facing 11 players, then his health will be 1100 (11 players x 100hp = 1100hp). Super fun game mode to participate and spectate. The game clock will also reflect how many people are in the game. For example, if there are 12 people in the game, there will be 4 minutes on the clock (20 seconds * 12 players = 240 seconds = 4 minutes).

<br><br>
### 🧍‍ Free For All
Free for all is pretty self-explanatory; all the players acquire the same health and sword. Then, the players teleport within the map in random locations. The last player to be standing wins the round. The winner will receive 1000 bells and 250 experiences.

<br><br>
### 💣 Time Bomb
The time bomb is by far my most favorite minigame within this game. This game is a swift hot potato game. One guy has the time bomb, and he must hand it off to another person before the 15 seconds is up. The person carrying the bomb will turn into a TNT to let the other players know he is the current holder. The game will continue until there are three players left in the game. The final three receive 300 bells and 50 experience for not being eliminated.

<br><br>
### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Team Deathmatch
Team deathmatch is pretty simple. This game mode splits all players into two teams like any other game. Each group will be labeled in-game with a red or blue arrow, so there is no confusion on who is on each team. When one team is left standing, the game crowns the victors. The remaining team’s reward is 200 bells each and some in-game experience.

<br><br>
### 🎯 Kill The Carrier
Kill the carrier is a different type of minigame. Everyone is out to get you, and you can’t defend yourself. One random player is selected, and that player has to survive as long as possible. When the carrier gets eliminated, the game will reward them based on how many players were in the game and how long he could stay alive multiplied by 3. So if the carrier were alive for 20 seconds while eight players were trying to eliminate him, he would get 480 bells (20 seconds * 8 players * 3 static multiplier = 480 bells). The player that stopped the carrier will be the new carrier, and the process will continue until there are three people in the match.

<br><br><br>
## 🗺 Different Types Of Maps
Allowing the change of geography where users battle is the most straightforward added feature that gives the game a unique experience. As the game started to gain popularity, I got tons of messages from people saying they wanted to make maps for Outrageous Blades. At the end of the game’s development, I ended with 32 maps created mainly by users other than me, which is neat. The map will change every round and have its strategy, depending on the game mode. This is the best feature that throws a wrench in the gearbox when it comes to players’ gameplay strategies.
